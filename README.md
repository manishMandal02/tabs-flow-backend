## Project Overview

TabsFlow Backend is a serverless application built on AWS, designed to manage tabs, spaces, and user data. It provides a robust backend infrastructure for [brief description of what TabsFlow does].

## Technologies

- **Core Language**: Golang (for services)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: TypeScript (for AWS CDK)
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
  - CDK (Infrastructure as Code)
  - API Gateway (REST APIs)
  - Cognito (Authentication & Authorization)
  - Lambda (Compute Services)
  - DynamoDB (Main Data Store)
  - SQS (Asynchronous Tasks)
  - SES (Transactional Emails)
  - CloudWatch (Monitoring & Logging)
  - EventBridge (Scheduling Future Tasks)

## Architecture

[TODO - high-level architecture diagram here]

Our serverless architecture leverages various AWS services to create a scalable and maintainable backend system. The core services are implemented as Lambda functions, with API Gateway serving as the main entry point for client requests.

## Entities

| Entity         | Description               | Attributes                                                    |
